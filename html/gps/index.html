<p>The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to provide information accessibility to people that may need assistance in differentiating various segments of a website.</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what the question is. If the elements aren't displayed in the order they are written, I would guess that they would go something like this: header, section, article, aside relating to section/article, footer. I'm not sure what order nav would be in, and main would encompess various semantics, so it would be the absolute first. </p>

<p> Snippets were definitely the main topic that I learned of in this challenge. I can definitely see myself creating snippets in the future. Perhaps to create a template in a language for a particular use.</p>

<p> The most challenging part of this challenge was probably learning the basic syntax of the snippet. At first it looked pretty confusing, but after we researched a bit, it made much more sense. We still weren't sure what the scope tag was for when we finished, however. </p>
