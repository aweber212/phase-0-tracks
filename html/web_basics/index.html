	<h1>James Bond's Best Flicks</h1>
	<p>James Bond has gone through loads of adventures. Those include <strong>23 movies</strong>, (25 if you include movies produced by other studio's!), ranging in setting from <em>space stations</em> to <em>underwater fortress'</em> to a <em>New Orleans</em> rife with voodoo magic.</p>
	<h3>Bond has also faced his fair share of evil supervillans! Some examples include:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Jaws</li>
		<li>Goldfinger</li>
		<li>The Man with the Golden Gun!</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Critics generally rate James Bond films in the following order:</h3>
	<ol> 
		<li>Goldfinger</li>
		<li>Dr. No</li>
		<li>From Russia with Love</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Although, recent Daniel Craig flicks Skyfall and Casino Royale have also begun to crack many folks' lists of top Bond flicks! In fact, this <a href="http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/james-bond-movies/5/"> Rotten Tomatoes</a> editorial even has Skyfall and Casino Royale as #1 and #2, respectively! HERESY! While Skyfall is my personal #2, nothing can ever supllant Goldfinger as <strong>the best Bond flick of all time.</strong></p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Goldfinger</strong></li>
		<li>Skyfall</li>
