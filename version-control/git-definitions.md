# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control allows the user to make save points of work being done. This is useful, because if there is an error or wrong code at that point going forward, instead of starting from scratch, one can simply go to the last save point. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is in effect a clone of folders or files. This clone allows someone (or multiple people) to work on the project, without changing the original, or master, project. When one finishes work on a branch, they can merge it back into the master file. This allows multiple people to work on one project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is the process of creating a save point in Git. A good message would be a description of what was done to necessitate a save file. IE, a discription of the work done.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when branches merge, and the branches have diverged. For example, there are commits in one branch, but not another.
